# Net-Score-Promoter-using-Numpy
Measuring a Net Score Promoter of a Survey Report 
Net Score Promoter of Survey Report
Overview:
This project calculates the Net Promoter Score (NPS) of a survey report. The NPS is a metric used to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction based on responses to a single question: "How likely are you to recommend our product/service to a friend or colleague?" The score ranges from -100 to +100.

Features:
Utilizes numpy for efficient numerical operations.
Provides a clear indication of customer sentiment towards the product/service.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
numpy library

Usage:
Prepare your survey data in a suitable format, ensuring it includes responses to the NPS question.
Import the numpy library and utilize the relevant functions from your project file.
Calculate the NPS using the provided function.

Interpret the NPS result:
NPS > 0: Generally indicates that the majority of respondents are promoters.
NPS = 0: Indicates an equal balance between promoters and detractors.
NPS < 0: Suggests that there are more detractors than promoters.

Example:
For example, a survey report yields an NPS of +23.7, indicating a positive sentiment among respondents.
